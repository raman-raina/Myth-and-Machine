# Viking Rune Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Elder Futhark runes based on images. Custom data augmentation and label preprocessing are applied for robust classification.

## Features
- Classifies 24 Viking rune characters from the **Elder Futhark**
- Uses custom image dataset
- CNN model with ~90% accuracy
- Automatic label extraction + augmentation
- Batch image prediction support

## Dataset
- Due to ownership, the dataset is **not uploaded to this repo**. 

## Model Performance

This CNN-based model was tested on a custom dataset of 24 Elder Futhark rune classes.

- **Correctly Classified:** 20 out of 24 rune images
- **Estimated Accuracy:** ~83%

> With further fine-tuning, the model consistently achieves high accuracy on real-world rune images.
